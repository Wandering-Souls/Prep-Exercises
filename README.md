## Week 2

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
  I find the second way better as it shows all the possible states, it also makes our code shorter and easy to understand.
- What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why?
  I tried the exercise with do-while loop and there was no change in this case, but in general it's better to not use do-while loop because even if the condition is not met do-while loop runs at least once as it evaluates the loop condition at the end of the loop.

- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?
  `While` loop and `for` loop both have the same performance, the main differences are their syntax and the way they work.
