This repository includes exercises of javascript HYF program.

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
I find the second the way better especially if we have many states, it makes our code shorter and easy to understand.
- What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why?
I tried the exercise with do-while loop and there was no change in this case,  but in general it's better to not use do-while loop because even if the condition is not met do-while loop runs at least once as it evaluates the loop condition at the end of the loop.

- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not? 
no idea about this question!
