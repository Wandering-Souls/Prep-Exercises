## Prep-exercises

This repository includes exercises of javascript HYF program.

## Week 2

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?  
  I find the second way better as it shows all the possible states, it also makes our code shorter and easy to understand.
- What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why?
  I tried the exercise with do-while loop and there was no change in this case, but in general it's better to not use do-while loop because even if the condition is not met do-while loop runs at least once as it evaluates the loop condition at the end of the loop.

- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not? **No!**
  `While` loop and `for` loop both have the same performance, the main differences are their syntax and the way they work.

## Week 3


- This time the loop was changed to a for loop that will run the code 6 times. Why was that needed?
- Why was the trafficLight added to the `main` function and not left at the top of the file?
- What do you think is the advantage of having the `getCurrentTrafficLightState` and `getNextStateIndex` functions?
- The `valueCounts` is implemented as an array. Do you think there is another way to store this? Why do you think the decision was made to go with an array?
- What do you think about the code division? Would you add another function or maybe remove one? Why?
